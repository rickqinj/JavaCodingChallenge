## INTRODUCTION

The solution provided here may be not the best one; however, I will try my best to make the solution much easier understandable and as much intuitive as I can.

Cause I am not a math guy or a genius who are really good at those brain-twisting algorithms, you don't expect that the algorithms here will work in the highly efficient way.

## CHALLENGES

- [Buildings Trap Rainfalls](https://github.com/rickqinj/JavaCodingChallenge/tree/master/src/main/java/com/magicphi/javacodingchallenge)

  You will implement a method to calculate how much rainfalls can be caught by the shape consisted of a group of buildings, which represented by an array.
