## Question

Giving a whole number, you are going to implement the factorial calculation of it in Java.

## Solution

*I definitely sure that there must be some much more efficient solution to solve this problem. Discussion on performance is not the focus of this post.*

As we all know, the Factorial Calculation formula looks as follows: `f(n) = n * f(n - 1)`. 
For example, `3! = 3 * (3 - 1)! = 3 * 2 * (2 - 1)! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`.
